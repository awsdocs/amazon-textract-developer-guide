# Amazon Textract API Permissions: Actions, Permissions, and Resources Reference<a name="api-permissions-reference"></a>

When you're setting up access control and writing a permissions policy that you can attach to an IAM identity \(identity\-based policies\), you can use the following as a reference \(for more information, see [Access Control](authentication-and-access-control.md#access-control)\)\. The table list includes each Amazon Textract API operation, the corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action, and the AWS resource that you can grant the permissions for\. You specify the actions in the policy's `Action` field, and you specify the resource value in the policy's `Resource` field\. 

You can use AWS\-wide condition keys in your Amazon Textract policies to express conditions\. For a complete list of AWS\-wide keys, see [Available Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

**Note**  
To specify an action, use the `textract` prefix followed by the API operation name \(for example, `textract:DetectDocumentText`\)\.

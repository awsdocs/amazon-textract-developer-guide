#### [ JavaScript ]

**SDK for JavaScript V3**  
 Shows how to use the AWS SDK for JavaScript to build a React application that uses Amazon Textract to extract data from a document image and display it in an interactive web page\. This example runs in a web browser and requires an authenticated Amazon Cognito identity for credentials\. It uses Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) for storage, and for notifications it polls an Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\) queue that is subscribed to an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic\.   
 For complete source code and instructions on how to set up and run, see the full example on [GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/textract-react)\.   

**Services used in this example**
+ Amazon Cognito Identity

#### [ Python ]

**SDK for Python \(Boto3\)**  
 Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\) with Amazon Textract to detect text, form, and table elements in a document image\. The input image and Amazon Textract output are shown in a Tkinter application that lets you explore the detected elements\.   
+ Submit a document image to Amazon Textract and explore the output of detected elements\.
+ Submit images directly to Amazon Textract or through an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\.
+ Use asynchronous APIs to start a job that publishes a notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic when the job completes\.
+ Poll an Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\) queue for a job completion message and display the results\.

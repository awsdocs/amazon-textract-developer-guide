# Form Data \(Key\-Value Pairs\)<a name="how-it-works-kvp"></a>

Amazon Textract can extract form data from documents as key\-value pairs\. For example, in the following text, Amazon Textract can identify a key \(*Name:*\) and a value \(*Ana Carolina*\)\.

Name: Ana Carolina

Detected key\-value pairs are returned as [Block](API_Block.md) objects in the responses from [AnalyzeDocument](API_AnalyzeDocument.md) and [GetDocumentAnalysis](API_GetDocumentAnalysis.md)\. You can use the `FeatureTypes` input parameter to retrieve information about key\-value pairs, tables, or both\. For key\-value pairs only, use the value `FORMS`\. For an example, see [Extracting Key\-Value Pairs from a Form Document](examples-extract-kvp.md)\. For general information about how a document is represented by `Block` objects, see [Text Detection and Document Analysis Response Objects](how-it-works-document-layout.md)\. 

Block objects with the type KEY\_VALUE\_SET are the containers for KEY or VALUE Block objects that store information about linked text items detected in a document\. You can use the `EntityType` attribute to determine if a block is a KEY or a VALUE\. 
+ A *KEY* object contains information about the key for linked text\. For example, *Name:*\. A KEY block has two relationship lists\. A relationship of type VALUE is a list that contains the ID of the VALUE block associated with the key\. A relationship of type CHILD is a list of IDs for the WORD blocks that make up the text of the key\.
+ A *VALUE* object contains information about the text associated with a key\. In the preceding example, *Ana Carolina* is the value for the key *Name:*\. A VALUE block has a relationship with a list of CHILD blocks that identify WORD blocks\. Each WORD block contains one of the words that make up the text of the value\. A `VALUE` object can also contain information about selected elements\. For more information, see [Selection Elements](how-it-works-selectables.md)\.

Each instance of a KEY\_VALUE\_SET `Block` object is a child of the PAGE `Block` object that corresponds to the current page\.

The following diagram shows how the key\-value pair *Name: Ana Carolina* is represented by `Block` objects\.

The following examples show how the key\-value pair *Name: Ana Carolina* is represented by JSON\.

The PAGE block has CHILD blocks of type `KEY_VALUE_SET` for each KEY and VALUE block detected in the document\.

The following JSON shows that the KEY block \(52be1777\-53f7\-42f6\-a7cf\-6d09bdc15a30\) has a relationship with the VALUE block \(7ca7caa6\-00ef\-4cda\-b1aa\-5571dfed1a7c\)\. It also has a CHILD block for the WORD block \(c734fca6\-c4c4\-415c\-b6c1\-30f7510b72ee\) that contains the text for the key \(*Name:*\)\.
